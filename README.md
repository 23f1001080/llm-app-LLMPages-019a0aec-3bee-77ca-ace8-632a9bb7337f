# GitHub Pages Portfolio Site

## Project Title and Description
This project generates a simple GitHub Pages site hosting a collection of diverse files as per a specific brief. It includes creative writing, ethical dilemmas, data structures, SVG graphics, and general web development components, demonstrating a range of full-stack development capabilities.

## Setup Instructions
This is a static site. No complex setup is required to view it locally. To run it locally, simply save all files in a directory and open `index.html` in your web browser.

To publish on GitHub Pages:
1.  Create a new GitHub repository.
2.  Upload all the provided files to the root of your repository's `main` (or `master`) branch.
3.  Navigate to your repository's settings.
4.  Find the 'Pages' section in the sidebar.
5.  Under 'Build and deployment', select 'Deploy from a branch'.
6.  Choose the `main` branch (or `master`) and the `/ (root)` folder as the source.
7.  Click 'Save'.

Your site will typically be live at `https://[your-username].github.io/[your-repo-name]/` within a few minutes.

## Usage Guide
Navigate to the `index.html` file in your web browser (either locally or via the GitHub Pages URL). The homepage provides a clear list of all the generated content files, each with a brief description. Click on any link to view the respective file's content directly in your browser.

## Code Explanation
This project is structured as a collection of static files:

*   `index.html`: Serves as the main entry point and navigation hub for the site. It provides links and descriptions for all other assets.
*   `ashravan.txt`: Contains a fictional short story (300-400 words) in the style of Brandon Sanderson, exploring the character Ashravan's post-restoration experiences and building to a dramatic climax.
*   `dilemma.json`: A JSON file detailing an ethical thought experiment concerning autonomous vehicle decision-making in two distinct moral dilemmas, including the chosen action and reasoning.
*   `about.md`: A simple Markdown file containing a concise, three-word personal description.
*   `pelican.svg`: An SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file illustrating a pelican riding a bicycle, demonstrating basic vector graphics generation.
*   `restaurant.json`: A JSON file recommending a good restaurant in Mumbai, complete with geographical coordinates, name, and suggested dishes.
*   `prediction.json`: A JSON file presenting a forecast for the Federal Funds rate by December 2025, accompanied by a brief rationale.
*   `uid.txt`: A plain text file containing a specific unique identifier string, included as-is per requirements.
*   `LICENSE`: The standard MIT License document, detailing the terms under which this project's code and content are distributed.

Each file is self-contained and serves its specific purpose as outlined in the project brief.
